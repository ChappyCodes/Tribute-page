                <h1 class="career">How she achieved this</h1>
                <p class="about">
                    Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh curbed a wider spread of the Western African Ebola virus epidemic 
                    in Nigeria  by placing the patient zero,
                    Patrick Sawyer, in quarantine despite pressure from the Liberian government.
                </p>
                    <p class="about">
                 As if Patrick Sawyer was deliberately trying to spread the ebola virus to top conference attendees,
                 Dr Adadevoh resisted him from escaping from the isolation room he was confined in and was quoted as 
                 saying, “for the greater public good”.
    
                 Through her efforts, the Nigerian index case was limited playing a key role in curbing the spread
                 of the virus in Nigeria.
